## Anuvaad - Localize your app in global languages!
An open source tool that you can use to localize your Android Apps!
It supports majority of global languages: Hindi, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Russian. I plan to add more as the community requires.

Can't wait to translate your app?
use it now @ [www.androidapptranslator.com](https://androidapptranslator.com)

#### You can translate your entire strings.xml file into any of these languages within few seconds.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
